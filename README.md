🚀 **Just launched my latest project – Reestar!**
A simple food-themed webpage built using **HTML** and **CSS** to showcase my frontend skills.

📁 **What’s Inside**:

* Clean navigation bar with “Home”, “Recipe”, and “Contact” sections
* Food card layouts with sample images and "Order Now" buttons
* Stylish, black-themed contact form with input fields
* Hover effects and neatly structured CSS classes

💡 **What I Learned**:

* Structuring HTML semantically
* Reusing CSS classes for modular styling
* Creating layouts using `inline-block` and centering elements

🛠️ **Next Steps**:

* Make it fully responsive for mobile devices 📱
* Add unique recipes and backend integration
* Improve form validation and interactivity with JavaScript

📚 This project helped me understand the basics of web development more practically. Looking forward to building on top of this!
